Brief Description: The Stock Portfolio Optimizer is a project designed to automate and optimize the process of choosing and purchasing stocks.
It fetches the stock data from a CSV file containing NASDAQ stock symbols and retrieves essential stock information such as current price and 
market capitalization from an API. The user is prompted to enter their portfolio size, and the program calculates the optimal number of shares to 
purchase for each stock to evenly distribute the investments across the entire portfolio. The results are then exported into a well-formatted Excel file 
with recommended trades. This project showcases the ability to efficiently gather and process financial data, perform calculations, and create 
a visually appealing report, demonstrating valuable skills in data analysis, financial programming, and user experience design.
The impact of this project is to assist investors in making informed decisions and creating a balanced and diversified stock portfolio with ease.
